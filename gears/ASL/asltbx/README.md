A gear for running [ASLtbx](https://cfn.upenn.edu/~zewang/ASLtbx.php). This gear requires no inputs; it uses the Flywheel SDK to download all of the input files. Designating the input files requires a two-step process in the Flywheel UI:

1. Assign a given tag to all of the sessions (in a given project - the gear only analyzes files in a project, not across projects) containing files you wish to analyze. This allows the gear to identify which subjects are being analyzed, as only sessions (not files) are associated with subjects.
2. Add a field named "tag" to the info object of every file you wish to analyze. The value of the field should be the same tag that you used in step 1. This tells the gear which actual files in a session are to be included in the analysis. (The information has to go in the files' info objects because files don't support actual tags.)

It is important that your files are named consistently. ASLtbx requires a T1 anatomical scan for each subject and a 4D ASL file per session (both in NIfTI format). The gear requires all of the structural file names to share one common prefix and all of the functional files to share a different common prefix.
